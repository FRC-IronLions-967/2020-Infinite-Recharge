# 2020-Infinite-Recharge
Robot Code for the 2020 FRC Infinite Recharge season.

C++ was attempted to see if we could make it work, it is currently not functional so... don't use it I guess??
Java works great, there might be some bugs somewhere but it worked well enough to make elims at our first regional.
Feel free to look at our code for reference, but we bear no responsibility for the questionable programming practices that Nathan might have employed.
